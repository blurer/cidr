# Network CIDR Calculator

####This project is a few things:
* Downloads the latest IPv4 and IPv6 addressing from AWS in json format.
* The python scripts will format the data in the desired manner.
* I am still learning Python and am planning to use json and variables to clean this up into a single script.

#####Long Term:
* Web interface
* Calculate the total IP addressing
